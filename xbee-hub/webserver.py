'''This is an experiment using cherrypy. It's a minimal web server to
make web services easier to implement. My use of it is to allow interprocess
comm easier to implement. Additionally, you can interface with it directly
using a browser. That should help in debugging various items when they act
up around the house.
It should also allow the various processes to be split between machines.
One machine could handle the lights, another the appliances, etc. You should
be able to expand a home control network forever.
This will bring up a web server on the address and port number specified in
the .houserc file like this:
"wemo":{
"ipAddress":"192.168.0.205",
"port": 51001},
So 'http"//192.168.0.205:5101' will get a 'hello world' response while the
terminal that started it will get a series of 'tick.' This illustrates that it
can respond to http and do something else at the same time.
This is only an experiment before combining the code into my home. It's going
to control the wemo light switches first, and then based on that, expand to
the other devices around the house. That's why the wemo references in the
file.
